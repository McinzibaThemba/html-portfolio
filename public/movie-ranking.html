<h1>The Best Movies that Mcinziba Themba watched</h1>

<h2>These are the top 3 since 2010</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. School Dance(2014)</h3>
<p>This is the funniest movie I have ever watched and it also has a touch of romance,
    which I appreciate.
</p>

<h3>2. Black Panther(2018)</h3>
<p>This is a great fiction movie mostly because of it's action but also because of the fact
    that it is one of a few movies made in hollywood that represents africa in a good light.
</p>

<h3>3. Spider-man Home Coming(2017)</h3>
<p>This is in my opinion the best Spider-man movie ever made, the reason is because of it's blend of teenage
    fiction and back when it was released I could relate to it because to some degree I was considered
    a genius in high school while I had my personal struggles.
